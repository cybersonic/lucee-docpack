These are passed to the function ImageFilters (see ImageFilter documentation).
		The ImageFilterKernel function defines a matrix that describes how a specified pixel and its surrounding pixels affect the value computed for the pixel's position in the output image of a filtering operation. 
		The X origin and Y origin indicate the kernel matrix element that corresponds to the pixel position for which an output value is being computed.
