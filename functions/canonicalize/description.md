Canonicalization is simply the operation of reducing a possibly encoded string down to its simplest form. 
		This is important, because attackers frequently use encoding to change their input in a way that will bypass validation filters, 
		but still be interpreted properly by the target of the attack. 
		Note that data encoded more than once is not something that a normal user would generate and should be regarded as an attack.
