Creates Hash-based Message Authentication Code for the given string based on the algorithm and encoding. 
		Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) is used to verify the data integrity and authenticity of a messagetransmitted. 
		It involves a cryptographic hash function in combination with a secret key. 
		The cryptographic hashfunction can be Message Digest 5 (MD5), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), and so on
